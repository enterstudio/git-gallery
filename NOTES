sign in with github page

first sign in I see update "username" kinda weird.
maybe should be a welcome page with some information about this site.

# FEEDBACK FROM JON #
#####################
necessary

JEN
- project index
  - center "Projects" title
    - make it H1

MICAH
- user edit
  - consistency with buttons
- project edit
  - project title isn't centered
  - whole form isn't centered
  - need space between each section title and the above section
  - button needs to be consistent with all the others (ie navbar name button)
- new feature
  - button needs to be consistent with all the others (ie navbar name button)

DESMOND
- project creation
  - notice of success needs to stand out more

MATT
- project show
  - make sure all headers are perfectly centered, as well as contributors
  - where is project image
  - not obvious to scroll down to features
    - anchors on contributors and features so click on link and it scrolls down for you
  - contributors
    - scroll bar on right side shouldn't be there



- new snippet
  - button consistency
  - back button

- new upload
  - button consistency
  - back button

- edit feature
  - top stuff centered, middle stuff not, looks weird...consistency
  - buttons need to be consistent throughout site
  - able to drag "add a slide" tab...shouldn't be able to...should always be at bottom or top
  - delete slide should have confirmation popup

- new slide (first)
  - button needs to be consistent with all the others (ie navbar name button)
    - separate done with slides from other two
      - should done with slides even be here? instead, just a back button?
  - header should be bigger
    - what's with that space by the header
  - text needs to be bigger
  - demo project should open up in modal or new page
  - link to project's repo should be here
    - open up in modal or new page

- new slide (not-first)
  - buttons up top should have same consistency through site
    - done with slides button should go at bottom
      - should be "Done Adding Slides" (drop "I'm")
  - add slide tab under slide names?
  - edit slide link?
  - headers should be bigger

OPTIONAL
- login process
  - instead of routing to github for signin, make it a iframe/modal and then refresh git gallery page once logged in (so you never leave gitgallery)
- navbar
  - search bar should search projects if on projects index and search users if on users index

=============================+
=============================+


  Come up with an actual email for the registration and project creation.
  set environment variables and gitignore them
  venera blue vs vbcustom

  user show page -
  example section needs to be kept and striped
  figure out about the stripiness
  figure out the build section buttons


  make the big button the build action and the smaller right button the show gh repo action
  make image the link to project show page
  on index pages



  on project show page -
  remove link from title and change text color for repo link.
  move edit this project on the hero section next to project title
  flash notice on project update should say project not user.


  project edit page

  project title label needs to be centered. h3 label 
  whole unit should be centered on page.
  image should be smaller
  increase width of description text box
  fix button hovers across site
  description label needs to be better h3 maybe
  truncate description on user show and project index
  
New Feature page...

  back to project button on left and submit centered

First new slide page

paragraph text bigger title too

make link visible.
redo database and have Git Gallery as the linked project.
open on new tab.

new image slide

styling is not there at all.

need to show thumbnail of slide on this page.

new slides not first

upload and copy buttons or links bigger and centered
im done button moved below main content

Feature Edit page 

flow is still not making sense
when you delete a slide it should keep you on the same page?

need to add the title name of the Feature in slide show.

project show feature avatar on title bar is not sized right
